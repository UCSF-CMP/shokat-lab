<p>Iâ€™m studying the cancer-causing mutations in GNAS, the gene that encodes the Î± subunit of the stimulatory G protein (GÎ±s). Activating mutations of GNAS have been revealed to contribute to progression and metastasis of several kinds of cancers. About 64% of these mutations result in a single variant called R201C, which keeps GÎ±s in a constitutively active state. Iâ€™m trying to fully understand the effect of this mutation on the activity of GÎ±s. Iâ€™m also interested in  developing small molecules to specifically inhibit the R201C mutant protein.</p>
