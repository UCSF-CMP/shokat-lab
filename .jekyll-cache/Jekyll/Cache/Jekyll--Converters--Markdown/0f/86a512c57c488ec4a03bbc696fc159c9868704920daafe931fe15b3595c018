<p>I am interested in studying how cells respond to changes in nutrient levels and how these pathways are altered in human diseases. My approach is to use chemical tools and crystallography to better understand the mechanisms of the enzymes involved in these processes. One enzyme that I am focusing on is the autophagy initiating kinase ULK1, which activates the autophagic process upon sensing nutrient deprivation signals. We have developed chemical approaches to studying these nutrient enzymes like ULK1, which we hope will provide new therapeutic opportunities.</p>
