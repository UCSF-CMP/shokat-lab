<p>A native New Yorker, Iâ€™ve been in California for 25 years now and call it home.  I have been in the academic/scientific sector since 2000 and feel proud supporting scientistsâ€™ efforts at groundbreaking discoveries!  I earned a B.S. in organizational behavior at USF and an M.A. in transpersonal psychology at ITP, in Palo Alto.  I get to apply all of these learned skills here in the Shokat lab and I am thrilled and grateful for the opportunity.  In my spare time I like reading, film, playing on the beach with my Havanese puppy, Belle, and letâ€™s not forget my favorite past timeâ€“ karaoke!</p>
