<p>I’m a graduate student in the Chemistry and Chemical Biology program. Mutations in LRRK2, a cytoplasmic kinase are commonly implicated in the development of familial of Parkinson’s Disease, and LRRK2 sequence variants also modify risk for sporadic PD. I am interested in developing tools to further investigate the relationship between the GTPase and kinase activity of LRRK2, and to expand these approaches to studying other cytoplasmic druggable GTPases implicated in human disease.</p>
