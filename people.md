In the Shokat lab, our goal is for every lab member to thrive both personally and scientifically. We believe that good science and good community both happen when we share.

We share our knowledge and skills and are always, always open to questions. We work to help each other succeed and then celebrate each other’s success.

We use chemistry to crack some of the toughest problems in human health (like kicking Ras), but we don’t take ourselves too seriously.

We are serious about building an inclusive lab where people of all backgrounds are welcome.

We value our time outside of lab as well as our time in it. We take the space we need to take care of ourselves.

Talk to any of us—we’re happy to tell you more!
