Our kinase database server (published at [DOI: 10.1093/bioinformatics/18.9.1274](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/18.9.1274)) unfortunately had to be retired due to its age (developed in 2002) and lack of security measures. We may someday relaunch it, but it is not currently an active project.

If you would like to identify the gatekeeper residue for your kinase of interest, please write to Kevan directly at [Kevan.Shokat@ucsf.edu](mailto:Kevan.Shokat@ucsf.edu) and one of the lab members will help you out.  We are sorry for the inconvenience.
