Our server for the Kinase Database (published in:  PMID: 12217924 DOI: 10.1093/bioinformatics/18.9.1274) had to be retired due to its legacy nature and its lack of security measures which we could not introduce since it was developed back in 2002.  If you would like to identify the gatekeeper residue for your kinase of interest please write to Kevan directly (kevan.shokat at ucsf.edu) and one of the lab members will help out.  We are sorry for the inconvenience.
