Our research laboratory at UCSF (http://shokatlab.ucsf.edu/) has two undergraduate summer research positions available immediately through August, 2020. Our group of 8 post-doctoral fellows and 8 graduate students explore chemical approaches to understand fundamental biology and develop therapeutics. The research is driven by chemical synthesis and human genetics. Completion of college level organic chemistry along with an interest in biological systems (cell biology and/or biochemistry coursework) would be ideal. Since our University does not allow undergraduate students to come to San Francisco this summer, these two positions would involve on-line participation in an ongoing project mentored by one or more of the lab members and involvement in our virtual research laboratory meetings. Projects to develop new anti-cancer drugs, cardiovascular medicines, treatments for Parkinson’s disease, lifespan extension and treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection are available (see our publications in these areas: http://shokatlab.ucsf.edu/pubs/).

While not a “hands-on” research experience, our laboratory has been operating largely virtually since early March 2020 and we have managed to keep our science moving forward. We believe through close mentoring including literature reading and analysis, experimental design, data interpretation, participation in drafting manuscripts and getting to know our devoted team of scientists the summer interns will find this an enriching experience. This internship would be an excellent experience for those considering graduate school in chemistry or biological sciences as well as professional school such as medical, public health, nursing or dental school.
