### The Shokat lab is accepting new lab members!
We are proud to welcome members of all backgrounds.

Our lab is mostly composed of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, but we are also open to interest from potential visiting scholars, as well as post-baccalaureate or current undergraduate students. If you are not sure whether you belong in the Shokat lab, please reach out to Kevan directly at [Kevan.Shokat@ucsf.edu](mailto:Kevan.Shokat@ucsf.edu).

### Postdoctoral fellows
Potential postdocs should reach out to Kevan directly at [Kevan.Shokat@ucsf.edu](mailto:Kevan.Shokat@ucsf.edu).

### Graduate students
The Shokat lab is located at UCSF but accepts graduate students enrolled either at UCSF or at UC Berkeley. At both universities, potential graduate students cannot apply directly to a lab. Instead, they must apply to a graduate program. Once accepted to a program, students rotate through several labs during their first year before arranging to join their thesis lab in the spring.

The Shokat lab can theoretically accept graduate students from many UCSF and Berkeley graduate programs. However, a few programs are most aligned with the lab's focus and have historically supplied most of the students in the lab:
- UCSF
    - [Chemistry and Chemical Biology](https://ccb.ucsf.edu/)
    - [Tetrad](https://tetrad.ucsf.edu/)
    - [Biomedical Sciences] (https://bms.ucsf.edu/)
    - [Biophysics](https://biophysics.ucsf.edu/)
    - [Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics](https://pspg.ucsf.edu/)
- Berkeley
    - [Chemical Biology](https://chembio.berkeley.edu/)
    - [Chemistry](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/grad/chem/about)

If you are not sure whether a graduate program you are interested in or enrolled in is compatible with joining the Shokat lab, please reach out to Kevan directly.
