I am interested in the initial events that lead to malignant transformation of a cell. Mutations, deletions, or amplifications in genes in either the p16-CDK4/6-Rb or p53-p21-CDK4/6-Rb pathways are commonly observed as key events that drive cancer. My project involves developing chemical probes to rescue the wild-type function of p53,p21, and p16 to restore their tumor suppressor function in cancer cells.
