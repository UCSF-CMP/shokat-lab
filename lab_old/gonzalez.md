I am a graduate student in the Chemistry and Chemical Biology graduate program. My interest is in using small molecules to modulate enzyme function, with the ultimate goal of expanding our understanding of disease. Currently, my project in the Shokat lab centers around synthesizing and characterizing small molecule activators of phosphoglycerate kinase, an important enzyme in glycolysis.
