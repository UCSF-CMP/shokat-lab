My research focuses on understanding host-pathogen biology by probing substrate partners of various eukaryotic-like serene/threonine kinases that are expressed as bacterial effector proteins. Using Legionella pneumophila as a model system, I am taking the analog-sensitive kinase approach developed by the lab to understand the substrates of L. pneumophilaâ€™s effector kinases. We hope to validate the functionality of an discovered phosphosites in the context of bacterial infection.
