My work focuses on DEAD box proteins, which are the largest family of RNA helicases in humans. These proteins play essential roles throughout RNA biology and are often misregulated in viral infections and cancer. Iâ€™m using a chemical genetics approach to develop tools to better elucidate the roles of DEAD box proteins in normal cellular processes and how these are altered in disease states.
