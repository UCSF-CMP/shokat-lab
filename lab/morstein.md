My research seeks to find new ways to modulate biological interfaces relevant to cancer signaling. To this end I am exploring new strategies to target key interactions that underlie the dynamic regulation of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling. Based on structural knowledge of these interactions, I aim to develop multifunctional small molecules that enable targeting of key interfaces.
