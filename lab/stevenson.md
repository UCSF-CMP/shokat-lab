Iâ€™m a graduate student in the Chemistry and Chemical Biology program. My research focuses on kinases. In my main project, I am trying to improve the specificity of kinase inhibitors by linking two inhibitors of the same kinase together to create bitopic inhibitors. These compounds are very large and flexible and flagrantly defy the classical Lipinski rules for drug development, but they can still sometimes have druglike properties. I am exploring this approach with the Bcr-Abl kinase as a test case.
