Iâ€™m a graduate student in the Chemistry and Chemical Biology program. My research focuses on CDK4 and -6, a pair of cyclin-dependent kinases that control entry into the cell cycle. These kinases are known to phosphorylate the RB-like family of proteins, but recent results in the field suggest that they may also have other important targets. I am using the Shokat lab's analog-sensitive approach to create mutant versions of CDK4 and CDK6 and use them to conduct an unbiased search for the targets of these kinases, with implications both for fundamental cell biology and for cancer therapy.
