My work in the Shokat Lab focuses on the development of small molecules to inhibit lipid kinases and modulate host-pathogen interactions. Specifically, I am interested in determining if inhibition of PIP5K1C can be a novel asthma treatment strategy, developing small molecule inhibitors of PI4KIII/PIP5K1A as broad-spectrum antivirals and the developing pharmacokinetic methods to assess how well the “bumped” inhibitors developed in the Shokat Lab are distributed in rodents with analog-sensitive alleles.
