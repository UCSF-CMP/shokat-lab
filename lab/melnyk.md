I am investigating how post-transcriptional gene regulation can impact the effectiveness of current therapeutic treatment strategies in cancer. I am particularly interested in the roles of up-regulated, non-mutated kinases and oncogenic proteins in RNA splicing, and the implication of these events in tumor progression. I hope to aid in advancing our understanding of the cellular decision-making processes in RNA splice site selection, and to develop chemical therapies targetable to dysregulated splicing events.
