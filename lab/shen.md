I am a graduate student in the Chemistry and Chemical Biology program. My research combines immunology and chemistry, with a focus on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and peptide presentation. I am interested in developing small molecules to facilitate MHC class I presentation of poorly presented oncoprotein-derived peptides for T cell recognition.
