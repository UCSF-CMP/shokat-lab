I am interested in developing chemical tools to understand the role of specific proteins in disease pathology and pathogenesis. We hope that these tools will uncover new therapeutic targets for the treatment of disease. I am currently working on an understudied class of proteins called RNA helicases, which are important for all steps of RNA biology. Using these tools, we hope to develop a better understanding of the individual roles these proteins play in healthy cells and uncover how these functions are altered in diseases like cancer and viral pathogenesis.
