Iâ€™m a graduate student in the Tetrad program. My research aims to understand the role of Rab proteins, a subfamily of Ras GTPases, in cellular trafficking and certain diseases using a chemical biology approach. To this end, I am seeking to develop specific small molecule probes to target individual Rabs.
